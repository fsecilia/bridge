# Bridge

Bridge makes supported foreign targets behave as locally as practical from a Linux development host.

## Win32 prototype

Bridge's Win32 profile cross-compiles with LLVM-MinGW and executes target programs through Wine. A small POSIX `sh` runner keeps Wine's background processes detached from captured test output so CTest does not wait for Wine's idle shutdown after each executable. The toolchain first honors `BRIDGE_LLVM_MINGW_ROOT`, then the environment variable of the same name, then searches a target-prefixed LLVM-MinGW compiler already on `PATH` and `/opt/llvm-mingw`. Bridge also adds LLVM-MinGW's target runtime DLL directory to Wine's executable search path.

A project using Bridge can include `external/bridge/cmake/BridgePresets.json` from its `CMakePresets.json`. Bridge's preset file includes Canon's presets and adds `win32-debug`, `win32-release`, `win32-asan`, `win32-tidy`, and `win32-coverage` with matching build, test, and workflow presets.

If LLVM-MinGW is installed in a nonstandard location, set the root explicitly when configuring:

```bash
cmake --preset win32-debug -DBRIDGE_LLVM_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/llvm-mingw
```

Machine-local paths do not need to be committed or added globally to `PATH`.
